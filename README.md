# Image Resizer Extension
Whenever you try to upload a photo ona awebsite or in a form, it asks you to upload a photo within a particular limit, 
in order to do that, you have to go to a third party app, and the process is too long. Here we team Titans came up with an idea 
of creating a chrome extension for that. Now, You just have to click on the extension and start using it, resize it hand to hand and upload.

#### here is the demo link which you can see for more clarity https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wPvMe1CS1qFVuTauHpWS8-Cu9IlDMdqq/view
